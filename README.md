![the night I implemented mnight](/docs/cover.png)

I've just wanted to practice some pytorch and I've decided to implement a simple MLP classifier for MNIST dataset. I've done it in one night while listening to [jungle dnb tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmStNF35o1w). I've called it `mnight`.
